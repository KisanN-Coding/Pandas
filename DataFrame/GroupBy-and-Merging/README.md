# Overview of Notebooks
 
The focus is on two fundamental operations: **GroupBy** and **Merging/Concatenation**. 
Each notebook includes explanations, worked-out examples, and practice questions for better understanding.

## Notebook 1: GroupBy in Pandas

### Description
The `GroupBy` operation in Pandas follows the **Split-Apply-Combine** approach:

- **Split** the data into groups 
- **Apply** a function (aggregate, transform, filter)
- **Combine** the results back into a DataFrame

This notebook explains how to analyze and summarize data efficiently using group operations.

### Contents
- Introduction to **GroupBy in Pandas**
- Applying **built-in aggregation functions** (`sum`, `mean`, `count`, etc.)
- Exploring **GroupBy attributes and methods**
- Applying **multiple aggregate methods** on grouped objects
- **Looping over groups** for custom operations
- Understanding the **Split-Apply-Combine** strategy
- Performing **GroupBy on multiple columns**
- **Practice Questions** for hands-on learning

## Notebook 2: Concatenation and Merging in Pandas

### Description
Combining datasets is a crucial step in data analysis. This notebook explores: 

- **Concatenation** → stacking DataFrames vertically or horizontally 
- **Merging** → SQL-style joins (inner, outer, left, right)

It also includes **practice problems on IPL dataset**, where player/team statistics are merged from multiple sources.

### Contents
- **Concatenation of DataFrames** (row-wise and column-wise)
- **Merging in Pandas** (joins using `merge()`)
- **Practice Questions** on concatenation and merging
- **Alternate Syntax for Merge**
- **More Practice Questions on IPL Dataset**
